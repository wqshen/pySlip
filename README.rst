pySlip
======

pySlip is a 'slip map' widget for wxPython.

During my work writing geophysical applications in python I often wanted to
display a map that was very large - many hundreds of thousands of pixels in
width.  I searched around for a GUI solution that would work rather like Google
maps: tiled, layers, etc.  I couldn't find anything that didn't assume
browser+map server.  So I wrote my own wxPython widget.  This worked well for
cartesian self-generated maps and has been extended to handle non-cartesian
maps and tiles sourced from places like OpenStreetMap.

It's a poor thing, but solves my problem.  I'm placing it here in the hope that
someone else may find it useful.  If you find it useful, or make improvements
to it, drop me a line.

pySlip works on Linux, Mac and Windows.  It only works with wxPython 2.x and
Python 2.x (at the moment).  At some point when wxPython matures I hope to
move to Python 3.X and later versions of wxPython.

The widget API is documented in
`the wiki <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlip/wiki/The-pySlip-API>`_.

Getting pySlip
==============

You can clone this repository, of course, and then do:

::

    python setup.py install

Or you could install through PyPI:

::

    pip install pyslip

Using pip is the recommended way to install pySlip as the cheese shop code
is guaranteed to work.  The code in the GitHib repository is, unfortunately,
a moving target.

Tile Usage
==========

Before using any tiles provided by pySlip modules, make sure you are not
transgressing any usage rules applied by the tiles provider.

Heavy usage of tiles probably means you should set up your own tile cache
server and write a Tiles module that gets tiles from your own server(s).
